# SEISMIC REDUCTION 
### Unsupervised Machine Learning: An Application to Seismic Amplitude vs Offset Interpretation ###

The aim of this project is to deliver a set of tools to enable the efficient exploration of the potential use of unsupervised machine learning techniques for the analysis of seismic data sets specifically the recognition of clustering of low fluid-factor anomalies derived from AVO analysis.

### Integration testing
Base cases wich have been verified to give the expected result have been logged and will be used in the integration tests to ensure the full analysis pipeline is working as expected

### Unit testing
Unit testing is employed to ensure the functions and methods of the software are delivering the expected outputs
